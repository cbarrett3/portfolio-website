    UW-Madison taught me how to balance my school, work, friends, health, and passions. It transitioned me from a confused freshman to a confident developer in 4 short years. I learned CS from leaders in their respective fields, and I contanstly felt motivated to learn by profressors, classmates and friends. On Wisconsin!
