    The goal of this project was to simplify the lives of elementary teachers by generating even classlists for them to provide the teachers in the grade above theirs.

    I started this project as a way of practicing python and helping my mother save time, and it has since grown into a useful application used by many of her co-workers.
    One of the most useful skills I learned through this project was how to optimize python code to improve runtime. This project has saved many hours for teachers, and hopefully will continue to in the future.
